Dalton's education went very little further than this; but, bad as it
was, its effect was blunted by the natural frankness and generosity of
his pretensions, errors which the world has always the watchful kindness
He was warmly and devotedly attached to his father and sisters, and
whatever bitterness found its way into his heart was from seeing them
enduring the many trials of poverty.
All his enthusiasm for the service in which he was about to enter was,
therefore, barely sufficient to overcome the sorrow of parting with
those, whom alone of all the world he loved; and when the moment drew
nigh for his departure, he forgot the bright illusions by which he had
so often fed his hopes, and could only think of the grief of separation.
His candle had burned down nearly to the socket, when he arose and
six o'clock. He opened the window, and a thin snowdrift came slanting
as he thought of the long and lonely march before him. All was silent
in the house as he dressed himself and prepared for the road. With
noiseless step he drew near his father's door and listened; everything
to the room where his sisters slept. The door lay ajar, and a candle was
burning on the table. Frank entered on tiptoe and drew near the bed, but

with a low sigh, he stole from the room.
As he passed out into the kitchen, Ellen was there. She had already
prepared his breakfast, and was spreading the table when he entered.
‚ÄúHush, Frank, they are both sleeping. Poor papa never closed his eyes

Again and again the brother and sister embraced; and in a very agony of
tears Frank tore himself away, and hastened down the stairs. The next
moment the heavy house door banged loudly, and he was gone.
Oh, the loneliness of mind in which he threaded his way through the dark
and narrow streets, where the snow already lay deeply! With what sinking
of the heart he turned to look for the last time at the window where the
light the only one to be seen still glimmered. How little could all the
promptings of hope suffice against the sad and dark reality that he was
parted. Loving her brother with an affection more like that of mother
than sister, she had often thought over the traits of his character,
where, with many a noble gift, the evil seeds of wrong teaching had
left, like tall weeds among flowers, the baneful errors of inordinate
self-esteem and pride. Ignorant of the career on which he was about to

over, or make appear as foibles, these graver faults. Their own narrow
fortunes, the very straits and privations of poverty, with all their

scarcely knew that he was not travelling in utter solitude, and all the
skilful devices of the worthy dwarf to turn the channel of his thoughts
were fruitless. Had there been sufficient light to have surveyed the
equipment of his companion, it is more than probable that the sight
imagined that a great majority of the human population of the globe were
either bandits or witches, had surrounded himself with a whole museum
of amulets and charms of various kinds. In his cap he wore the tail of
a black squirrel, as a safeguard against the ‚ÄúForest Imp;‚Äù a large dried
toad hung around his neck, like an order, to protect him from the evil
eye; a duck's foot was fastened to the tassel of his boot, as a talisman
direction. Of all the portions of his equipment, however, what seemed
the most absurd was a huge pole-axe of the fifteenth century, and which
inflict injury upon others. It had been originally stored up in the Rust
Kammer, at Prague, and was said to be the identical weapon with which
Conrad slew the giant at Leutmeritz, a fact which warranted Hans in
emphatic words, ‚Äúit was not every day one knew where to find the weapon
he fell into a moody silence, and thus they journeyed for miles of way
without interchanging a word. At last they came in sight of the little
the regular line that leads through the Hohlen Thai to the Lake of
Constance, and where they were to part.
‚ÄúI feel as though I could almost go all the way with you,‚Äù said Hans, as
they stopped to gaze upon the little valley where lay the village, and
‚ÄúNay, Hans,‚Äù said Frank, smiling, as for the first time he beheld the

‚ÄúI would like to take service with the Empress myself,‚Äù said Hans, ‚Äúif
it were for some good and great cause, like the defence of the Church
against the Turks, or the extermination of the race of dragons that
infest the Lower Danube.‚Äù
Frank, preferring to offer a correction to the less startling of his
‚ÄúNo, no, Master Frank, they have not deposed the good Maria Teresa,
they would never do that. I saw her picture over the doorway of the

Wald, and by the same token her crown and sceptre were just newly gilt,
a thing they would not have done if she were not on the throne.‚Äù

change that came over the dwarf's features.

and he gave no further opposition; and now they both descended the
path which led to the little inn of the village. Here Hans insisted on
performing the part of host, and soon the table was covered with brown

‚ÄúShe is so beautiful!‚Äù exclaimed Hans, fervently. ‚ÄúExcept the Blessed
Maria at the Holy Cross, I never beheld such loveliness. There is the
Angelus ringing; let us pray a blessing on them;‚Äù and they both knelt
‚ÄúAnd yonder is the dog-star, bright and splendid,‚Äù said Hans, as he
arose. ‚ÄúThere never was a happier omen for the beginning of a journey.
You 'll be lucky, boy; there is the earnest of good fortune. That same
star was shining along the path as I entered Baden, eighteen years ago;
Frank could not but smile at the poor dwarf's appreciation of his
who made the world so fair and beautiful; but in my heart was planted
a desire to be something to do something, that others might benefit by.
The children used to mock me as I passed along the road; but a voice
whispered within me, 'Be of courage, Hanserl, they will bless thee yet,
they will greet thee with many a merry laugh and joyous cry, and call
thee their own kind Hanserl:' and so have I lived to see it! My name
me amongst the first words they syllable; and from the palace to the

the stage drove up by which Hans was to return to Baden. A few hurried
lingering squeeze of the hand,

Young and untried as Frank Dalton was in life, he was not altogether
unprepared for the vicissitudes that awaited him; his sister Nelly's
teachings had done much to temper the over-buoyant spirit of his nature,
the present, rather than to gild the future.
His heart was sorrowful, too, at leaving a home where unitedly they
revealed it how much can be endured in companionship, and how the burden
of misfortune like every other load is light when many bear it. Now
thinking of these things, now fancying the kind of life that might lie
before him, he marched along. Then he wondered whether the Count would
resemble his father. The Daltons were remarkable for strong traits of
comfort Frank felt in fancying that the old general would be a thorough

others for the importance that they attach to the ties of kindred,
making the boast of relationship always superior to the claims of
self-formed friendships. This is perhaps more peculiarly the case among
those who live little in the world, and whose daily sayings and doings
are chiefly confined to the narrow circle of home. But yet it is

distinguished them all, and they all agreed in maintaining the claim of
relationship as the strongest bond of union; and it was strange into
their name, assumed a kind of religious value in their eyes, and the
word Dalton was a talisman to exalt the veriest trifle into the rank of
relic. From his earliest infancy Frank had been taught these lessons.
They were the traditions of the parlor and the kitchen, and by the mere
the theme of every story. The ancient house of the family, and which,
although by time's changes it had fallen into the hands of the Godfreys
from whom his mother came was yet regarded with all the feelings of
ancient pride. Over and over again was he told of the once princely
state that his ancestors held there, the troops of retainers, the
mounted followers that ever accompanied them. The old house itself was
exalted to the rank of a palace, and its wide-spreading but neglected
grounds spoken of like the park of royalty.
To see this old house of his fathers, to behold with his own eyes the
seat of their once greatness, became the passion of the boy's heart.

his hopes, and, after a journey of eight long days, find himself at the
At first the disappointment was dreadful. The proud mansion, of whose
adorned with statues, but of which the pedestals alone remained. A few
hedges of yew, with here and there the fragments of a marble figure or
fountain, showed that the old French chateau taste had once prevailed
there; and of this a quaint straight avenue of lime-trees, reaching
directly from the door to the river, also bore evidence. The tone of
sadness and desertion was on everything; many of the lower windows were
walled up; the great door itself was fastened and barricaded in such a
stirring about the place, and save that at night the flickering light
of a candle might be descried from a small casement that looked upon the
garden, the house might have been deemed uninhabited. Perhaps something
in the mysterious desolation of the scene had its influence over the
lay in the deep grass, watching the cloud shadows as they stole along,
he grew fondly attached to the place; now losing himself in some revery
of the long past, now following out some half-remembered narrative of
his mother's childhood, when she herself dwelt there.
All his little resources of pocket-money expended, his clothes, save
about to sail for the Scheldt, gave him the opportunity of returning
approach the house, and ask to see his uncle, and now repelled by
remembering all his unkindness to his father. Then marvelling whether
some change might not have taken place in the old man's mind, and
whether in his lonely desolation he might not wish once more to see his

garden at the back of the house, and whence he had often watched the
solitary light that marked the old man's vigils.

footsteps near him at least so they sounded on the gravel-walk of the
garden, and in a few minutes after the grating sound of a key, and the
opening of a small door which led out into the wood. He now perceived
that a man was standing at the foot of the knoll, who seemed irresolute
and undecided; for he twice returned to the door, once introduced the

The hour the scene itself the evident secrecy of the man, almost
paralyzed the boy with terror; nor was it till long after the turf was
replaced, dry leaves and dead branches were strewn over the spot, and
the man himself gone, that Frank gained courage to move away. This he
did at first cautiously and timidly, and then with a speed that soon
carried him far away from the spot. The following day he was at sea;
and if at first the strange scene never left his thoughts, with time the
impression faded away, till at length it assumed the indistinctness of a
had been, and the object for which he went; but, even to her, from some
strange love of mystery, he told nothing of the last night's experience:
life, at first, and subsequently the changeful scenes of opening
manhood, gradually effaced the impression of what he had seen, or merely
left it to all the indistinctness of a dream.
And thus are thoughts often sealed up in the memory for years unnoticed
and unknown till, after a long interval, they are all called forth, and
become the very pivots on which turns our destiny.

pony, laid up in ordinary for the winter, was again trimmed and curried

and a worsted tassel to the bridle, in all the seductive attraction of
a palfrey. Even flower-girls made their appearance again with a few

Meanwhile were the fortunate individuals for whose benefit these
exertions were evoked, in the most blissful ignorance of all the
interest they were awakening. From the first moment of their arrival
none had even seen them. Waited upon by their own servants, scarcely
heard, not even appearing at the windows, they were unconsciously
around them. As, however, nothing of secrecy had any share in their
proceedings, we have no scruple in invading the presence and introducing
the reader to the company.

ALONG the dark and narrow street, over which the coming night cast a
dreary shadow, a single lamp was seen to shine at the door of Ludwig
Kraus, the apothecary; a beacon, it is but fair to add, lighted less
with the hope of attracting custom than in obedience to the requirements
of the law, for Herr Kraus was a ‚Äústate‚Äù official, and bound to conform
to the dictates of the government. His shop was a small triangular
space, in which there was barely room for the learned dispenser and a
single client at the same moment, thus giving to all his interviews the
secrecy of the confessional itself. Jars, phials, flasks, and drawers
rose on every side, not inscribed with the vulgar nomenclature of modern
physic, but bearing the enigmatical marks and hieroglyphics known to
zodiacal signs met the eye everywhere, and did not consort ill with the
spare form and high bald head of the proprietor, whose quaint-figured
alchemist in his workshop. As Grounsell approached the glass door
and peeped in, the scene that presented itself rather assisted this
illusion, for straight in front of the little counter over which Kraus
was leaning, sat the dwarf, Hans Roeckle, talking away with considerable
animation, and from time to time seeming to expatiate upon the merits

the words. Having read it through, he handed back the paper with a

‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù cried Grounsell, not understanding the meaning of this speech.
Hans repeated it more slowly, and at length succeeded in conveying the

to the apothecary that he might venture to transgress the law in the
present case when the season was over, and no one to be the wiser.
As Hans issued forth to show the way, he never ceased to insist upon
the fact that the present was not a case for a fee, and that the doctor
should well understand the condition upon which his visit was to be
paid; and still inveighing on this theme, he arrived at the house where
the Daltons dwelt. ‚ÄúRemember, too,‚Äù said Hans, ‚Äúthat, though they are
poor, they are of guten stamm how say you, noble?‚Äù Grounsell listened
‚ÄúI will go before. Stay here,‚Äù said Hans, as they gained the
landing-place; and so saying, he pushed open the door and disappeared.

limbs and wasted cheek portrayed fasting and exhaustion, while in the

did not make the best of the bad. Lady Hester grew hourly more irritable
and peevish. Sydney Onslow seldom left her room. George took to the
hills every morning, and never returned before a late dinner; while the
doctor, when not with Sir Stafford, spent all his time at the Dal tons',
while away the hours; she had spent whole days in letter-writing folios
of ‚Äútirades‚Äù to every one she could think of. She had all the carriages
inspected, and the imperials searched, for books she well knew had
been left behind. She had sent for the landlord's daughter to give her
lessons in German, which she thought of learning during the week. She
had given a morning to the Italian boy with his white mice, and pored
for hours long over the ‚ÄúLivre des Voyageurs,‚Äù reading the names of
friends who, with better fortune, had taken their departure for Italy.

This was a rather more embarrassing demand than the previous one, and

conversation if the word can be degraded to mean that bald disjointed
chat ran upon London people and events their marriages, their dinners,
their separations, coalitions, divorces, and departures; on all
which themes Haggerstone affected a considerable degree of knowledge,

can possibly consist with what one reads occasionally in the ‚ÄúTimes‚Äù and

The second category is the Roland to this Oliver, and embraces those who

It may seem strange that Lady Hester, who had lived a good deal in the

He was shrewd enough soon to detect the family differences that
prevailed, and to take advantage of them, not by any imprudent or

of the hotel.
True to his word, he had selected a very pretty alley, at the end of

objects are capable of, a handsome case of pistols, with all the varied
appliances of kid leather for wadding, bullet-moulds, rammers, hammers,
screws, and rests, even to a russia-leather bound note-book, to record
the successes, nothing had been forgotten; and Lady Hester surveyed with

overjoyed to think that their chance acquaintance should be one of that
grace and fascination of the high-born, Kate watched with eager and
delighted looks the slightest gestures, the least traits of manner, of

gave a ready response. The accent in which she spoke, the careless
elegance of her attitude as she lay back in her chair, the charming
negligence with which she wore the little portions of dress exchanged
for her own, were all inimitable graces in the eye of the simple girl.
As for Lady Hester, accustomed to all the servile offices of her own

sisters ministered to her wants. In utter forgetfulness of themselves,
they had brought forth the little resources of their humble wardrobe,
too happy, as it seemed, when they saw their services so willingly
accepted. Fortunately, they did not perceive the contemptuous looks

Whether Lady Hester was aware of the theory or not, she felt the fact,

for while she had won over Nelly by the elevation of her sentiments and
the kindness of her expressions, Kate was fascinated by her beauty, her

Although, unquestionably, the postscript of this elegant epistle was the
part which reflected most severely upon the writer's good feeling and

individual referred to. Even then all that he could remember was, that

that the hotel was closed, the door strongly secured, and all the usual
precautions of the night taken, in the belief that the inmates were
already safe within doors. In vain he knocked and thundered at the
massive panels; the few servants occupied rooms at a distance, and heard
nothing of the uproar. He shouted, he screamed, he threw gravel against
the windows, and, in his zeal, smashed them too. All was fruitless;
nobody stirred, nor could he detect the slightest sign of human presence
in the vast and dreary-looking building before him. The prospect was
not a pleasant one, and a December night in the open air was by no means
desirable; and yet, where should he turn for shelter? The other hotels
were all closed and deserted, and even of the private houses not one

the hotel; but here all his efforts proved just as profitless as the

attached to the wall, offered an easy access. George was an expert
climber, and in less than a minute found himself seated on the
window-sill, and gazing into a room by the aperture between the
a servant's room. The bare, whitewashed walls; the humble, uncurtained
bed; three chairs of coarse wood, all strengthened this suspicion, even

throwing its gloomy gleam over the whole. For a moment or two George was
unable to detect the owner of this simple repast, as he was engaged in
the table, spreading his napkin before him, and surveying the board with
an air of self-satisfaction such as a gourmand might bestow upon the
gentlemanlike; a little foppish, perhaps, in the arrangement of his
hair, and somewhat too much display in the jewelled ornaments that
studded his neckcloth. Even in his attitude, as he sat at the table,
there was a certain air of studied elegance that formed a curious
contrast with the miserable meal before him. Helping himself to a

disposed to laugh at the disparity of the entertainment and him who
partook of it, there was something in the scene which repressed his
The piercing cold of the night at length admonished him that
he should provide for his own admission into the hotel; and although
natural reluctance at the pain he must occasion to the stranger,

privations are only endurable because they are practised in secret, and
at no sacrifice of worldly estimation. How can I then or what right have
I to inflict the torture of an exposure upon this young man, whoever
acted upon; for he determined to spend the night, if need be, in
the open air, rather than accept an alternative so painful in its
consequences. His resolutions had usually not long to await their
accomplishment; and, turning his back to the window, and disdaining the
slow process by which he had gained the ascent, he sprang with one leap
down to the ground: in doing so, however, his elbow struck the window,
and at the same instant that he reached the earth, the shivered
fragments of a pane of glass came clattering after him. In a moment the
sash was thrown open, and a head appeared above. ‚ÄúI have smashed the
window,‚Äù cried George, in French, ‚Äúas the only means of being heard.
They have locked me out of the hotel, and I don't fancy spending a
winter's night in walking the streets of Baden.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou're an Englishman,‚Äù said the voice from above, in English.
‚ÄúYes; but I don't see what that has to do with the matter,‚Äù replied
‚ÄúIf you 'll have the goodness to come round to the front door,‚Äù said
the voice, one of the very softest and meekest of voices, ‚ÄúI shall have
great pleasure in opening it for you.‚Äù And at the same time the unknown
held forth his candle in polite guidance to the other's steps.
‚ÄúThanks, thanks; never mind the light. I know the way perfectly,‚Äù said
George, not a little ashamed at the contrast between his own gruffness
and the courtesy of the stranger whose window he had broken.
Onslow had barely time to reach the front door of the inn, when it was
that the broken pane was not of the slightest inconvenience, that the

ONSLOW'S first thought, on awaking the next morning, was of last night's
acquaintance, but all the information he could obtain concerning him was
that he was an Englishman who had passed the summer in Baden, and during
the season knew and was known by every one. The waiter called him, in
the usual formulary, ‚Äúa very nice gentleman;‚Äù and seemed by his manner
to infer that any further account might be had by paying for it. Onslow,
if he even understood the hint, was not the man to avail himself of it;
so he simply ordered him to bring the hotel book, in which the names of
all travellers are inscribed, and at once discovered that the proprietor
of the humble entresol, No. 6, was a Mr. Albert Jekyl, with the ordinary

materials from which to compile a history, but at least they conveyed
one inference, and that a very common one, that the height of Mr.
Jekyl's fortune and that of his dwelling observed to each other an

the opportunity of doing a kindness, he was even better pleased at the
thought of how their acquaintance at the ‚ÄúGrosvenor‚Äù and the ‚ÄúUltras‚Äù
 would laugh at the ‚Äúsharp viscount's being sold.‚Äù There was only one man

the most expensive tastes. ‚ÄúCould this by possibility be the man he had

darker topics which form the staple of scandal. A very gentle ridicule

portrayed were usually done by some passing bit of mimicry of the
individual in question. These he threw into the dialogue of his story

by this incidental trait he might be able to realize all the menaced
‚ÄúSirrah, ye 're an old fool!‚Äù said Dalton, angrily; and, jerking the key
from his trembling fingers, he pushed past him, and ascended the stairs.
If Dalton's impatience had been excited by the old man's absurd terrors
partake of old Andy's fear of the dread official of the law. Andy, who,
forgetting time and place, not knowing that they were in another land,
where the King's writ never ran, saw in the terrible apparition the
the banshee with a sudden death, as the sight of an attorney with an
not so easily effaced. And as the liberated captive is said to tremble
at the clanking of a chain, so his heart responded to the fear that
breath. ‚ÄúThey 've left me nothing but life, and they can't take that. It

his coat, and prepared to confront the enemy bravely.
Although Dalton made some noise in unlocking the door, and not less in
crossing the little passage that led to the sitting-room, his entrance
was unperceived by the stranger, who was busily engaged in examining a
drummer-boy read to him the bulletin of a great victory. She had
destined the work for a present to Frank, and had put forth all her

Mr. Prichard was probably not grieved at the prospect of a more

Kate, as she spoke, had opened the door of the little bedroom, and,
drawing her arm within her father's, gently led him forward to where
Lady Hester was seated upon the humble settle.
‚ÄúIt's a nice place they showed you into, my Lady,‚Äù said Dalton, after
the ceremony of introduction was gone through; ‚Äúand there was the

riotous and extravagant living, their lawlessness, and their daring;

Kate accordingly hastened to discover the cause of a tumult in which now
the sound of laughter mingled.
As we, however, enjoy the prerogative of knowing the facts before they
could reach her, we may as well inform the reader that Andy, whose
intelligence seemed to have been preternaturally awakened by the sight
of an attorney, had been struck by seeing two strangers enter the
house-door and leisurely ascend the stairs. At such a moment, and with
his weak brain filled with its latest impression, the old man at once
set them down as bailiffs come to arrest his master. He hobbled after
them, therefore, as well as he could, and just reached the landing as

of Jekyl's fingers, and scattered the contents all over the landing and
all!‚Äù And the taunt was so far true that the ground was strewn with
kreutzers and other copper coins of the very smallest value.

concocted the whole plot together here, Sir Stafford, it is needless
I omitted nothing of plausibility, either in proof of the bequest, or in
the description of the feeling that prompted its fulfilment. I descanted
upon the happy event which, in the course of what seemed an accident,
had brought the two families together, and prefaced their business
intercourse by a friendship. I adverted to the good influence increased
comforts would exercise upon her father's health. I spoke of her sister

And now the old baronet sat down to ponder in his mind the reasons for
so strange an event as a visit in the forenoon from Lady Hester. ‚ÄúWhat
can it mean? She can't want money,‚Äù thought he; ‚Äú't is but the other

them more tolerant and more attached, while in his own family, where

me, how yellow you are! or is it the light in this horrid room? Am I so

to suppress them.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am quite sure of that; nor is it my habit to afflict others with

vulgarly persists in calling you, as much as the others.‚Äù
Not that, for my own part, I have the least objection to any amount of
detestation with which he may honor me; it is the tribute the low and

incident to suit the tastes of his company.‚Äù

recalling the Daltons, and bringing to mind the circumstances she
desired to remember. ‚ÄúIt was exactly of these poor people I came to
speak. You must know, Sir Stafford, that I have made the acquaintance
of a most interesting family here, a father and two daughters named

represented in the most odious light. The amiable doctor will have,
doubtless, imputed to me the least worthy motives for knowing persons in
their station?‚Äù
‚ÄúOn the contrary, Hester. If he expressed any qualification to the
circumstance, it was in the form of a fear lest the charms of your
society and the graces of your manner might indispose them to return
with patience to the dull round of their daily privations.‚Äù
would be, then, the best antidote he could advise them! But, really,

to dissipate low spirits and banish ennui, and, with the advantages of

of society that mannerism of the world she is deficient in more than
Hester; but I see some very great objections to the whole scheme, and
regard the young lady herself. Would it be a kindness to withdraw her
from the sphere wherein she is happy and contented, to mingle for a
season or so in another and very different rank, contracting new habits

This must be a matter of diplomacy, of which the first step is, however,

at the bare thought of it. The dear child! with what rapture she heard
me speak of the balls, and fetes, and theatres of the great world!
of the thousand fascinations society has in store for all who have a
rightful claim to its homage, the tribute rendered to beauty, greater
than that conceded to rank or genius itself! I told her of all these,

Lady Hester, who at the opening of the interview had spoken with all the
of gainsay. Some experience had taught him the impolicy of absolute
eventualities, which, whether the campaign be civil, military, or
conjugal, is not without a certain degree of merit. In the present case
there were several escape-valves. The Daltons were three in number,
and should be unanimous. All the difficulties of the plan should be
arranged, not alone to their perfect satisfaction, but without a wound
to their delicacy. Grounsell was certain to be a determined opponent to
the measure, and would, of course, be consulted upon it. And, lastly,

Daltons together, or better still you shall go alone. No, no; a letter
will be the right thing, a very carefully written letter, that shall
refute by anticipation every possible objection to the plan, and show
the Daltons the enormous advantages they must derive from it.‚Äù
‚ÄúEnormous they certainly will be!‚Äù exclaimed she. ‚ÄúFirst of all, Kate,
to benefit the others, who, poor things, can do nothing for themselves.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you did say so! I forget all about it. Well, there was something or
other that brought the families in relation, no matter what, and it must
be a great satisfaction to you to see the breach restored, and through
my intervention, too; for I must needs say, Sir Stafford, there are
occupied the first place in their husband's esteem.‚Äù

attachments.‚Äù Here her Ladyship, who had unwittingly glided from the

be ill under his care. I remember when William, the footman, broke his
grate the fractured ends of the bone together.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd was William convinced of the no-pain doctrine?‚Äù cried Sir Stafford,
but Clarus said it would take at least two centuries to conquer the
prejudices of the common people.‚Äù

HAS the observant reader ever remarked a couple of persons parading the
with the same short jerk, to resume the same short path, and yet
never interchanging a word, the rhythm of the footfall the only tie of
companionship between them? They halt occasionally, too, to look over
the bulwarks at some white sail far away, or some cloud-bank rising from
the horizon; mayhap they linger to watch the rolling porpoises as they
pass, or the swift nautilus as he glides along; but yet never a sound
nor token of mutual intelligence escapes them. It is enough that they
live surrounded by the same influences, breathe the same air, and step
in the same time; they have their separate thoughts, wide, perhaps, as
the poles asunder, and yet by some strange magnetism they feel there is
a kind of sociality in their speechless intercourse.

A chance glance through the window, an occasional halt to listen when
the thunder rolled louder and nearer, showed that, to a certain extent,
the same emotions were common to each; but nothing else betrayed any

Haggerstone gave a short ‚ÄúHa!‚Äù at the heresy of this speech, but made no
other comment on it.
‚ÄúPerhaps not, if she were to consult me on the matter,‚Äù said Jekyl,
blandly; ‚Äúbut as this is, to say the least, not very probable, I may own
that I like the mixed marriages well enough.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Onslows are scarcely the people to succeed in that way,‚Äù rejoined

guide them.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot a bad pilot, either, as times go.‚Äù
Haggerstone uttered another short, ‚ÄúHa!‚Äù as though to enter a protest
against the sentiment without the trouble of a refutation. He had
the banker's family, or even obtain from that excessively cautious young
gentleman the slightest approach to an opinion about them; and yet it

clew to these people's thoughts, or habits, or their intentions for the
coming winter, that he had promenaded for the last hour and a half.
‚ÄúIf he know anything of them,‚Äù thought Haggerstone, ‚Äúhe will be but too
proud to show it, and display the intimacy to its fullest extent!‚Äù
It was, then, to his utter discomfiture, he learned that Jekyl had

spreading of your napkin. No; he knew all the importance of a

The difficulty was not, then, how to have treated Jekyl, but whether to
treat him at all. Indeed, the little dinner itself had been all planned
and arranged that morning; and the ‚Äútrout‚Äù from the ‚ÄúMurg,‚Äù and the
grouse from Eberstein, had been ‚Äúpricked off,‚Äù in the bill of fare, for
about the dish of whole truffles with butter, in the fair intention of
inviting Mr. Albert Jekyl to partake of them.

to chance the rotations of the seasons, or the motions of the heavenly
asparagus at Christmas, show a solicitude to please to the full as
ardent, and not a whit less sincere, than the soft glances that have

cons of the invitation.

incredulous amazement in the colonel's face; ‚Äúand I perceive,‚Äù added he,

occurred, the Daltons were seated round the fire, beside which, in the
Hans Roeckle. A small lamp of three burners such as the peasants use
stood upon the table, of which only one was lighted, and threw its
fitful gleam over the board, covered by the materials of a most humble
meal. Even this was untasted; and it was easy to mark in the downcast
and depressed countenances of the group that some deep care was weighing
upon them.
Dalton himself, with folded arms, sat straight opposite the fire, his
heavy brows closely knit, and his eyes staring fixedly at the blaze,
as if expecting some revelation of the future from it; an open letter,
Nelly, with bent-down head, was occupied in arranging the little
tools and implements she was accustomed to use in carving; but in the
tremulous motion of her fingers, and the short, quick heaving of her
chest, might be read the signs of a struggle that cost heavily to

eyes, while at intervals a short sob would burst forth, and break the

There was an air of sadness over everything; and even the old spaniel,
Joan, as she retreated from the heat of the fire, crept with stealthy
step beneath the table, as if respecting the mournful stillness of the
scene. How different the picture from what that humble chamber had so
often presented! What a contrast to those happy evenings, when, as the
Jean Paul, or the wild and fanciful imaginings of Chamisso, while
of Ireland, to ask at what they were laughing, and Frank look up
distractedly from his old chronicles of German war to join in the mirth!
How, at such moments, Hans would listen to the interpretation, and
with what greedy ears follow the versions the girls would give of some
or its beauty marred by transmission! And then those outbreaks of
which, though clothed in the language of a foreign land, spoke home to
their hearts with the force that truth alone can speak!
Yes, they were, indeed, happy evenings! when around their humble hearth
came thronging the groups of many a poet's fancy, bright pictures of
unison with their own. They felt no longer the poverty of their humble
condition, they had no memory for the little straits and trials of the
bygone day, as they trod with Tieck the alley beneath the lindens
of some rural village, or sat with Auerbach beneath the porch of the
Vorsteher's dwelling. The dull realities of life faded before the vivid
conceptions of fiction, and they imbibed lessons of patient submission
and trustfulness from those brothers and sisters who are poets'
And yet what no darkness of adversity could rob them of the first gleam

accents, the dwarf heard them, and nodded his head twice, as though to

just what he always was. But think of me! think of the expectations I
was reared to, the place I used to hold, and see me now!‚Äù

At last she ceased, and all was still; not a sound was heard in the
little room, and Nelly leaned her head down upon the table and wept.
But while she wept she prayed, prayed that if the season of trouble
her thoughts foreshadowed should be inevitable, and that if the cup of
sorrow must, indeed, be drained, the strength might be sent them for
the effort. It might have been that her mind exaggerated the perils of
separation, and the dangers that would beset one of Kate's temper and

THE lamp in Kate Dalton's chamber was still burning when the morning
dawned, and by its uncertain flicker might be seen the two sisters, who,
clasped in each other's arms, sat upon the low settle-bed. Nelly, pale
should awaken her, Nelly had leaned against the wall for support, and,
It was not alone the grief of an approaching separation that oppressed
her. Sad as it was to part from one to whom she had been mother and
fears for the future. Loving Kate dearer than anything in the world, she
was alive to all the weak traits of her character: her credulity,
were well known to her; and while, perhaps, these very failings, like
traits of childish temperament, had actually endeared her the more
to Nelly, she could not but dread their effect when they came to be
exercised in the world of strangers.
Not that Nelly could form the very vaguest conception of what that world
were all unknown to her. It had never been even the dream-land of
companionship with the great and titled, she had associated all
her thoughts with those whose life is labor; with them were all her
sympathies. There was a simple beauty in the unchanging fortune of the
peasant's life such as she had seen in the Schwarzwald, for instance
that captivated her. That peaceful domesticity was the very nearest
approach to happiness, to her thinking, and she longed for the day when
her father might consent to the obscurity and solitude of some nameless
‚ÄúDorf‚Äù in the dark recesses of that old forest. With Frank and Kate,
was now to lose the other too. ‚ÄúStrange turn of fortune,‚Äù as she said,
friendless want and necessity we held together; it is only when the

and soaring aspirations, demands another and a different sphere of
and self-reproach be if I saw that, in submitting to the same monotony
of this quietude, they should have become wearied and careless, neither
taking pleasure in the simple pastimes of the people, nor stooping to
their companionship! And thus all may be for the best,‚Äù said she, half

of evil fortune, often suggests, as its last consolation, the notion of
Both of these conditions were Nelly's; she had ‚Äúsupped sorrow‚Äù from her
cradle, while her estimate of herself was the very lowest possible. ‚ÄúI
suppose it is so,‚Äù said she again; ‚Äúall is for the best.‚Äù
She already pictured to herself the new spring this change of fortune
would impart to her father's life: with what delight he would read the
letters from his children; how he would once more, through them, taste

tears rose in her eyes. ‚ÄúI am but the image of our fallen fortunes, and

words escaped, her father, with noiseless step, entered the chamber.

trifle more besides. And that 's her trunk!‚Äù said he, after another
pause, his voice dropping at the words, as though to say, ‚ÄúWhat a change
of fortune is there! I wonder neither of you hadn't the sense to take

trouble a little sincerity with the world would save us.

nothing but sorrow for the present; and, for the future, difficulty, if

IF the arrival of a great family at an hotel be a scene of unusual
bustle and excitement, with teeming speculations as to the rank and the
wealth of the new-comers, the departure has also its interests, and
even of a higher nature. In the former case all is vague, shadowy, and
uncertain. The eye of the spectator wanders from the muffled figures
as they descend, to scrutinize the lackeys, and even the luggage, as
indicative of the strangers' habits and condition; and even to the
shrewd perceptions of that dread functionary, the head waiter, the
identity of the traveller assumes no higher form nor any more tangible
shape than that they are No. 42 or 57.
When the hour of leave-taking has come, however, their characters have
become known, their tastes and habits understood, and no mean insight
obtained into their prejudices, their passions, and their pursuits. The
imposing old gentleman, whose rubicund nose and white waistcoat are the
guarantees for a taste in port, has already inspired the landlord with
and sunshine, have all written themselves legibly in ‚Äúthe bill.‚Äù The
morning, are not unrecorded virtues; while even the pale young ladies,
Their hours of rising and retiring, their habits of society or
seclusion, their preferences for the ‚ÄúPost‚Äù or the ‚ÄúTimes,‚Äù have all
silently been ministering to the estimate formed of them; so that in the
commonest items of the hotel ledger are the materials for their history.
And with what true charity are their characters weighed! How readily
does mine host forgive the transgressions which took their origin in
his own Burgundy! how blandly smile at the follies begotten of his
Johannisberg! With what angelic temper does the hostess pardon the
dear, dear friends would but read us with half the charity, or even
bestow upon our peccadilloes a tithe of this forgiveness! And why should
it not be so? What are these same friends and acquaintances but guests
in the same great inn which we call ‚Äúthe world‚Äù? and who, as they never
take upon them to settle our score, need surely not trouble themselves
about the ‚Äúitems.‚Äù
While the Daltons were still occupied in the manner our last chapter has
described, the ‚ÄúHotel de Russie‚Äù was a scene of considerable bustle, the
preparations for departure engaging every department of the household
to oil, imperials to buckle on, cap-cases to be secured; and then what a
of in the most convenient places. Every corridor and landing was blocked
up with baggage, and the courier wiped his forehead, and ‚Äúsacre'd‚Äù in
half desperation at the mountain of trunks and portmanteaus that lay
lacquered leather, with the initials A. J. in brass on the top.

are two in the fourgon, and a cap-case on the large carriage.‚Äù
‚ÄúI'm going away, Monsieur Gregoire. I'm off to Paris,‚Äù was the reply, as
the speaker closed the sash and disappeared.
‚ÄúShe has given her demission,‚Äù said the courier, pompously. ‚ÄúResign her

Whatever apathy and indifference he might have met with from the English

his edicts right royally, and soon the courtyard was strewn with trunks,
not devoid of tumult; for, while each of the helpers screamed away at
the top of his throat, and Gregoire rejoined in shouts that would have
done credit to a bull, the parrot gave vent to the most terrific cries
and yells as the ape poked him through the bars of his cage with the
‚ÄúThere, that's one of them,‚Äù cried out Monsieur Gregoire; ‚Äúthat round

‚ÄúBelle tigresse!‚Äù exclaimed he, returning the leer she bestowed; and the
window was once more closed upon her exit. ‚ÄúI submitted to the labor,
in the hope we had done with you forever,‚Äù said he, wiping his forehead;
‚Äúand la voila there you are back again. Throw that ape down; away wid

he dare not attack the mistress. ‚ÄúBut what have we here?‚Äù
This latter exclamation was caused by the sudden entrance into the

go up with the luggage and be kept dry, for there 's valuable effects
‚ÄúIt 's a trunk, and belongs to me, and my name is Peter Dalton, as the
letters there will show you; and so no more about it, but put it up at
‚ÄúBe quiet, now, and do as I tell you, my little chap. Put these trifles,
‚ÄúIt 's not pork; 't is mutton, and a pigeon in the middle,‚Äù said Dalton,
‚ÄúIs the leetle old man to go too?‚Äù asked Gregoire, with an insolent
grin, and not touching the profanation of either cheese or basket.
A very deliberate stare, without uttering a word, was all the reply
Gregoire returned to this speech; and then, addressing himself to the
helpers, he gave some orders in German about the other trunks. Dalton
the courier even remembered his presence; and at last he said,
gray eyes that, had the other known him better, he would scarcely have
fancied, ‚Äúthat's it, then!‚Äù And taking the umbrella from beneath Andy's
arm, he walked deliberately across the yard to where a large tank stood,
the post-horses. Some taper rods of ice now stood up in the midst, and a
tolerably thick coating covered the surface of the basin.
Gregoire could not help watching the proceedings of the stranger, as
with the iron-shod umbrella he smashed the ice in one or two places,
piercing the mass till the water spouted up through the apertures.
‚ÄúHave you any friend who live dere?‚Äù said the courier, sneeringly, as
the sound of the blows resembled the noise of a door-knocker.
‚ÄúI'll tell you,‚Äù said Dalton. ‚ÄúI'm breaking the ice for a new
acquaintance;‚Äù and, as he spoke, he seized the courier by the stout
leather belt which he wore around his waist, and, notwithstanding his
struggles and his weight, he jerked him off the ground, and, with a
swing, would have hurled him head foremost into the tank, when, the
leather giving way, he fell heavily to the ground, almost senseless from
shock and fright together. ‚ÄúYou may thank that strap for your escape,‚Äù
 said Dalton, contemptuously, as he threw towards him the fragments of
broken leather.

Gregoire, brushing off the dirt from his sleeve, and shaking his cap.

treacherous smiles whose expression the courier began to comprehend. ‚ÄúNo
‚ÄúI am no Diener; no serve anybody,‚Äù cried the courier, indignantly.
But somehow there was that in old Dalton's face that gave no
encouragement to an open resistance, and Monsieur Gregoire knew well the
case where compliance was the wisest policy. He also knew that in his
vocation there lay a hundred petty vengeances more than sufficient to
my times,‚Äù was the reflection with which he soothed down his rage, and
affected to forget the insult he had just suffered under.

It had been the scene of many a happy ramble in the autumn, of many a
delightful excursion, when, with Frank, they used to seek for fragments
of wood that suited Nelly's sculptures. How often had they carried their
little basket up yonder steep path, to eat their humble supper upon the
rock, from which the setting sun could be seen! There was not a cliff
nor crag, not a mossy slope, not a grass bank, they did not know; and
now, as they looked, all the past moments of pleasure were crowding upon
their memory, tinged with the sad foreboding that they were never again

tall dark rock, on whose slopes the drifting snow had settled. ‚ÄúHow sad

sparkling along the grass when we sat together. I can bear to part with

‚ÄúI was thinking, dearest,‚Äù said Nelly, ‚Äúthat when we were met together
there on that night, none of us foresaw what since has happened. Not

whatever else might betide, seemed at least bound up together. Our very

forward to where Dalton was standing, at the corner of the street.

of his hand in the direction of the hotel. ‚ÄúTake my arm, each of you.‚Äù

of it lay in this fact. Every little gesture, every motion, the merest

pleasures which had no alloy in her own humble lot, and why desert them?
Was this, then, all that was needed to give her the stamp and semblance

Kate's heart was almost bursting as she heard these words. To speak thus
of the little valley would have been a profanation at any time, but to

The party had scarcely seated themselves at table when they were joined

carriages drawn up before the door, the relays all been ordered along
the road, the supper bespoken for the end of the journey. These pleasant

IN one of the most favored spots of that pleasant quay which goes by
the name of the Lungo l'Arno, at Florence, there stood a small,
the force of collision. In all probability it owed its origin to some
petty usurpation, and had gradually grown up, from the unobtrusive
humility of a cobbler's bulk, to the more permanent nuisance of stone
of bridles, halters, and such-like gear, with here and there the
brass-mounted harnessing of a Calasina, or the gay worsted tassels
useless; hence, everything that pertained to sale was carried on in the
street, thus contributing by another ingredient to the annoyance of this
owner to remove to another part of the town. Gigi every one in Florence
other resisted oppressions as manfully as he was proof against
indifference to the jarred nerves and chafed susceptibilities of his
fine neighbors. It was not that the man was indifferent to money. It was
not that the place was associated with any family reminiscences. It was
not from its being very favorable to the nature of his dealings, since
his chief customers were usually the frequenters of the less fashionable
localities. It was the simple fact that Gigi was a Florentine, and, like
a Florentine, he saw no reason why he should n't have the sun and
the Arno as well as the Guiciardoni, who lived at his right, or the
Small and contracted as that miserable frontage was, the sun did shine
upon it just as pleasantly as on its proud neighbors, and the bright
Arno glided by with its laughing ripples; while, from the little window
above stairs, the eye ranged over the cypress-clad hill of San Miniato
and the fair gardens of the Boboli. On one side lay the quaint old
structure of the Ponte Vecchio, with its glittering stores of jewelry,
and on the other the graceful elliptic arches of St. Trinita spanned the
stream. The quay before the door was the chosen rallying-point of
all Florence; the promenade where lounged all its fashionables of an
evening, as they descended from their carriages after the accustomed
drive in the Cascini. The Guardie Nobili passed daily, in all their
scarlet bravery, to and from the Pitti Palace; the Grand Ducal equipage
never took any other road. A continual flow of travellers to the great
hotels on the quay contributed its share of bustle and animation to the

questions of every coterie. In a few days more the Carnival would begin,
and yet no announcement of their intentions had yet gone forth, no
programme of future festivities been issued to the world. A vague and
terrible fear began to prevail that it was possible they meant all

If the courts of law and equity be the recognized tribunals by which the
rights of property are decided, so there exists in every city certain
claims, and deliver judgments upon the pretensions of every new arrival
amongst them. High amid the number of these was a certain family called
maiden sister of the General. They inhabited a small house in a garden
within the boulevard, dignified by the name of the ‚Äú41 Villino Zoe.‚Äù It
had originally been the humble residence of a market-gardener, but, by

as compassion, the life of an enduring self-devotion. Martha had had but
one idol all her life, her brother; and although, when he married late
in years, she had almost died broken-hearted at the shock, she clung to
knowledge of the world; but to see her at the time of which we now

separation of the two girls, just at the very moment of a budding
friendship, was sorrowfully felt by both, to Lady Hester the event was

was a double happiness, which, in spite of all the decorous restraints
bad news impose, actually displayed itself in the most palpable form.
The Palazzo Mazzarini was now to be opened to the world, with all the
splendor wealth could bestow, untrammelled by any restriction the taste
of Sydney or the prudence of the doctor might impose. Sir Stafford, ever
to nothing. The cheapness of Italy, the expectations formed of an
Englishman, were the arguments which always silenced him if he ventured
on the very mildest remonstrance about expenditure; and Jekyl was
immediately called into the witness-box, to show that among the
economies of the Continent nothing was so striking as the facilities of
entertaining. George, as might be supposed, had no dislike to see their
own house the great centre of society, and himself the much sought-after
and caressed youth of the capital.

characteristic expression of the face. Her mouth, however, when she

wondering delight at the tasteful decorations of her little chamber, a
perfect gem of elegance in all its details; then she would start up to
step out upon the terrace, where even in winter the orange-trees were
standing, shedding their sweet odor at every breeze from the Arno. With
what rapturous delight she would follow the windings of that bright
river, till it was lost in the dark woods of the Cascini! How the sounds
of passing equipages, the glitter and display of the moving throng,
stirred her heart; and then, as she turned back within the room, with
what a thrill of ecstasy her eyes rested on the splendid ball-dress
which Nina had just laid upon the sofa! With a trembling hand she
touched the delicate tissue of Brussels lace, and placed it over her

‚ÄúEvery one, Mademoiselle, every one, as they were standing beneath the

Onslow; and then my Lady took it up, and said, 'You are quite right,

‚ÄúThe Count de Melzi was more enthusiastic than even the rest. He vowed

the terraced vine lay stretched beneath. She tried to fall back upon the

longer the calm lake, on whose mirrored surface snow-peaks and glaciers
were reflected; it was not of those crags, over which the wild-fig and

sides of which Mademoiselle Nina had much to say. In all these little
discussions, the mock importance lent to mere trifles at first amused
only to listen to them with attention, but even to take her share in
the consultation. Nina's great art lay in her capacity for adapting a
costume to the peculiar style and character of the wearer; and, however
exaggerated were some of her notions on this subject, there was always
any absurdity in her theory. Kate Dalton, whose whole nature had been

There was enough of singularity, of the adventurous, in the nature of
her position, to excel all the romance of her nature; there was more
truth to the highest flights of her imagination. Had she been the sole
daughter of the house and name, flatteries and caresses could not have
inquired, her taste evoked on every occasion. And yet, with all these

and weary-looking, they seemed as though they were tired of a life of
dissipation, and yet utterly incapable of engaging in any other.
All born to high rank, some to large fortune, they found that no other
career was open to them except vice in one shape or other. The policy
of their rulers had excluded them from every road of honorable ambition;
neither as statesmen nor soldiers could they hope to win fame or glory.
Their habits of life and the tone of society gave no impulse to the
cultivation of science or literature. The topics discussed in their
circle never by chance adverted to a book; and there they were, with
away life in the dullest imaginable routine of dissipation, their minds
neglected, their hearts corrupted, enervated in body, and deprived of
all energy of character; they wore, even in youth, the exhausted look of
age, and bore in every lineament of their features the type of lassitude
In the adjoining room sat Kate Dalton at a tea-table. She was costumed
whose length of stomacher and deep-hanging sleeves recalled the
portraits of Titian's time; a small cap covered the back of her head,
through an aperture in which the hair appeared, its rich auburn masses
with precious stones; a massive gold chain, with a heavy cross of the
same metal, was the only ornament she wore. Widely different as was the
dress from that humble guise in which the reader first knew her, the
internal change was even greater still; no longer the bashful, blushing
girl, beaming with all the delight of a happy nature, credulous,
gentle-mannered; the placid smile that moved her lips, the graceful
attraction secondary to the fascination of her manner. It is true the

fresh and buoyant sallies of her ready wit, had departed, and in their
a quiet but watchful spirit of repartee, that flattered by the very
more beautiful now than before; that intercourse with the world, dress,
manners, the tact of society, the stimulus of admiration, the assured
sense of her own charms, however they may have detracted from the moral
more striking fascinations. Her walk, her courtesy, the passing motion
and elegance. Two persons were seated near her: one of these, our old
acquaintance, George Onslow; the other was a dark, sallow-visaged man,
his features were marked by the hard lines of time, his figure had all
the semblance of youth. By a broad blue ribbon round his neck he wore
the decoration of Saint Nicholas, and the breast of his coat was covered
with stars, crosses, and orders of half the courts of Europe. This was

the assassination of the Emperor Paul, had never been reconciled to

compressed lips, and the long, projecting chin, seeming even longer

great events of politics, watching eagerly the changeful features of the

At the tea-table the conversation languished, or only went forward at

topic he started should be instantly adopted by the company.

into another channel, by asking Kate if she had ever read Fourier's
book. From this he wandered away to the characteristic differences
of national music, thence to the discoveries then making in Central
America, and lastly, engaged her in an animated discussion of the
question of slavery. On none of these points was he deeply or even well

legislature. We have been led to these reflections by having to
chronicle the arrival in Florence of Lord Norwood; a vague and confused
sorrow for him; others said he was a capital fellow, up to everything,
and that they were delighted at his coming. A few, of very tender and
languishing virtue themselves, wondered if they ought to meet him as
before; but the prevailing impression was charitable. The affair
at Graham's might have been exaggerated, the Newmarket business was

if he were to take the decided line of cutting a man without due cause,

Sir Stafford stood, during the whole of this speech, with his arms

the feelings of those who engage in them, and of the rules of honor by
which they are guided; but this I know, that the man whom his equals

To have seen them both at that moment, few would have guessed aright on
which side lay all the disgrace, and where the spirit of rectitude and

Sir Stafford would dine in the library, and her Ladyship in her own
room, George Onslow alone appearing in the dining-room. There was an air
of melancholy over everything, the silence deepening as night came on.
Servants went noiselessly to and fro, drew the curtains, and closed
the doors with a half-stealthy gesture, and seemed as though fearful of

therefore proceed to Sir Stafford's dressing-room, where the old Baronet
sat moodily over the fire, his anxious features and sorrow-struck
expression showing the ravages even a few hours of suffering had
inflicted. His table was littered with papers, parchments, and other
formidable-looking documents. Some letters lay sealed here, others were
half-written there; everything about him showed the conflict of doubt
painful struggle was maintained there.
For some time back he had seen with displeasure the course of
extravagance and waste of all his household. He had observed the habits
would be made with the coming summer, he had forborne to advert to
anxiety presented itself, in the class of intimates admitted by Lady
Hester to her society. Of the foreigners he knew comparatively
little; but that little was not to their advantage. Some were wealthy
voluptuaries, glad to propagate their own habits of extravagance among
those they suspected of fortunes smaller than their own. Others were
their profit. All were men of pleasure, and of that indolent, lounging,
active lives, and been always immersed in the cares and interests of

warmth on both sides, till Sir Stafford palpably hinted at the possible
to conjugal welfare. Her Ladyship caught up the suggestion with avidity,
there was none in writing the word, ‚ÄúSeparation.‚Äù
If the thought had already familiarized itself to his mind, the word had
not; and strange it is that the written syllables should have a power
and meaning that the idea itself could never realize.
To men who have had little publicity in their lives, and that little
always of an honorable nature, there is no thought so poignantly
miserable as the dread of a scandalous notoriety. To associate their
names with anything that ministers to gossip; to make them tea-table
talk; still worse, to expose them to sneering and impertinent
criticisms, by revealing the secrets of their domesticity, is a torture
sight of his name in the list of directors of some great enterprise, as
the patron of a charity, the governor of an hospital, or the donor to an
without a sense of shrinking delicacy; but to become the mark for public
discussion in the relations of his private life, to have himself and his
family brought up to the bar of that terrible ordeal, where bad tongues

one stage of the road. She had abundant examples around her of those
best received and best looked on in society, whose chief claim to the
world's esteem seemed to be the contempt with which they treated all its
ordinances. There was a dash of heroism in their effrontery that pleased
other people; their increased liberty seemed to impart enlarged and more
generous views, and they were always ‚Äúgood-natured,‚Äù since, living in
the very glassiest of houses, they never ‚Äúshied‚Äù a pebble.
While, then, Sir Stafford sat overwhelmed with shame and sorrow at the
bare thought of the public discussion that awaited him, Lady Hester was
speculating upon condolences here, approbation there, panegyrics upon
upon the strange unsuitableness of her marriage with a man so much her

company, but always allows them a respite for a dejeuner at the court,
or a supper after the Opera, with a few chosen convives, but a real,
pathetic. Such were the different feelings with which two persons
contemplated the same event. Sir Stafford's thoughts turned instantly
towards England. What would be said there by all those friends who had
compassion was even less endurable than the malice of others; and
sudden? In his heart Sir Stafford was glad that the doctor was absent;
much as he needed his counsel and advice, he still more dreaded the

them, and that, before that very night closed in, they had mutually
agreed upon a separation, which while occupying the same house, was
happiness was very wide apart from her situation as the companion of a
unfair to her own family, as unjust to the girl herself, to detain her
then in such a conjuncture. And yet what was to be done? Apart from all
the unpleasantness of proposing an abrupt return to her home, came
the thought of the avowal that must accompany the suggestion, the very
confession he so dreaded to make. Of course the gossiping of servants
would soon circulate the rumor. But then they might not spread it beyond
the Alps, nor make it the current talk of a German watering-place. Thus
the struggle was not a long one. He sat down and wrote to Lady Hester.
Naturally assuming that all the reasons which had such force for himself
would weigh equally with her, he dwelt less upon the arguments for
Kate's departure than upon the mode in which it might be proposed and
carried out. He adverted with feeling to the sacrifice the loss would
inflict upon Lady Hester, but professed his conviction in the belief
she is already attracted. We have exposed her to all the seductions of
to be realized, and we must now consign her to a home where all the
affections of fond relatives will be unequal to the task of blinding her
about to write 'recompense;' nor would the word be unsuitable recompense

The note concluded with some hints as to the manner of making the
communication to Kate, the whole awkwardness of which Sir Stafford, if
The whole temper of the letter was feeling and tender. Without even in
the most remote way adverting to what had occurred between Lady Hester
and himself, he spoke of their separation simply in its relation to Kate
Dalton, for whom they were both bound to think and act with caution.
As if concentrating every thought upon her, he did not suffer any other
consideration to interfere. Kate, and Kate only, was all its theme.
Lady Hester, however, read the lines in a very different spirit. She had
almost all vitality, suspended, under the influence of an exaggerated
credulity, when the letter was laid upon the table.
‚ÄúWhat is that your maid has just left out of her hand?‚Äù asked the
The doctor gave a look of triumph at the bystanders, and went on:
‚ÄúHas the letter come from a distant country, or from a correspondent
‚ÄúWhere is the writer at this moment?‚Äù asked he.
‚ÄúIn the house,‚Äù said she, with another and more violent shuddering.
‚ÄúI now take the letter in my hand,‚Äù said the doctor, ‚Äúand what am I
The doctor showed the letter on every side, with a proud and commanding
gesture. ‚ÄúThere is a name written in the corner of the letter, beneath
the address. Do you know that name?‚Äù
A heavy, thick sob was the reply.
‚ÄúThere there be calm, be still,‚Äù said he, majestically motioning
and tranquil. ‚ÄúAre the contents of this letter such as will give you
A shake of the head was the answer.
‚ÄúAre they painful?‚Äù
‚ÄúWill these tidings be productive of grand consequences?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat will you do, when you read them?‚Äù
‚ÄúIn compliance with the spirit, or in rejection?‚Äù
‚ÄúSleep on, sleep on,‚Äù said the doctor, with a wave of his hand; and, as
deception and trick, whose philosophy teaches them to discredit all that
they cannot comprehend. I trust you may never be of this number.‚Äù
‚ÄúLike all the secrets of nature, its phenomena are above belief; yet, to

seem with the whole order and spirit of creation. The great system of

descent. It is not on fallible evidence that I read the future.‚Äù

words, delivered oracularly, the doctor left the room, while Kate seated
herself beside the sofa where Lady Hester slept.
It was late in the night when Lady Hester awoke, and soon remembering
that a letter had arrived, broke the seal and read it. If the proposal
of Sir Stafford was in every way unacceptable, there was something which
compensated for all in the excitement of spirits an act of opposition
made the not uncommon error of mistaking sorrow for repentance, and
steps. It is difficult to say whether such an amende would have

Kate's letter home, then, was full of gay revelations. Galleries,
gorgeous displays of splendor. Well and sweetly were they written; a

with the world, was preeminent in all she said; while a certain sharp

A little dinner at the Villino opened the plan of proceedings. It was

the reputed son of a supposed son of George the Fourth, was received as
exceedingly like his grandfather, just on the same principle as red
remote village of the East, but finding that there were neither fees nor
perquisites, Foglass had left his post to besiege the doors of Downing
 for the morning papers.
Foglass was essentially a ‚Äúhumbug;‚Äù but, unlike most, if not all other
humbugs, without the smallest ingredient of any kind of ability.
When men are said to live by their wits, their capital is, generally
a pistol, but ready to ‚Äúpocket‚Äù either an ‚Äúinsult‚Äù or a ‚Äúball.‚Äù if the
occasion require it. None of these gifts pertained to Foglass. He

After all, it was a harmless sort of pastime; and if these ‚ÄúImaginary
Conversations‚Äù gave them pleasure, why need we grumble?
We have scruples about asking our reader even to a description of the
bouquet of flowers: there was a lavish display of what seemed silver;
there was a good deal of queer china and impracticable glass; in
short, much to look at, and very little to eat. Of this fact the Pole's
appreciation was like an instinct, and as the entrees were handed round,
all who came after him became soon aware of. Neither the wine nor the
dessert were temptations to a long sitting, and the party soon found
themselves in the drawing-room.
‚ÄúSon Excellence is going to England?‚Äù said the Pole, addressing Foglass,
‚ÄúAh! the poor dear Count!‚Äù sighed Mrs. Ricketts, while Martha prolonged

As these thoughts passed through his mind, weariness, the silence of the
hour, the darkened room, induced slumber; and although once or twice he

Onslow, on the return from his dinner-party. He lay for some minutes
expecting to hear his step upon the stair, and see him enter the room;
when he heard the sound of a hand upon the lock of the door.
It is one of the strange instincts of half-slumber to be often more
alive to the influence of subdued and stealthy sounds than to louder
noises. The slightest whisperings, the low murmurings of a human voice,
the creaking of a chair, the cautious drawing back of a curtain will jar
upon and arouse the faculties that have been insensible to the rushing
flow of a cataract or the dull booming of the sea.
Slight as were the sounds now heard, Norwood started as he listened to
them, and, at once arousing himself, he fixed his eyes upon the door, in
which the handle was seen to turn slowly and cautiously. The impression
The door at last opened; at first, a very little, and slowly, then
gradually more and more, till, by the mysterious half-light to which his
eyes had grown accustomed, Norwood could see the flounces of a female

uncertain flame of the fire showed him thus much, but left the remainder
of the figure in deep shadow.

a mile in front, had been his travelling companion for the past week.
Disdaining to follow the winding high-road, Frank ascended by those
foot-tracks which gain upon the zig-zags, and thus soon was miles in
advance of the caleche. At last he reached the half-way point of ascent,
and was glad to rest himself for a few minutes on one of the benches
which German thoughtfulness for the wayfarer never neglects to place
in suitable spots. A low parapet of a couple of feet separated the road
from a deep and almost perpendicular precipice, at the foot of which,
above two thousand feet beneath, stood the village of Stuben. There was
the little chapel in which he had his morning's mass, there the
little Platz, where he had seen the post-horses getting ready for the
travellers; there, too, the little fountain, covered with a shed of
straw, and glistening with many an icicle in the bright sun. The very
voices of the people reached him where he sat; and the sounds of a
street-organ floated upwards through the still atmosphere. It was a

There was a frankness in the way this offer was made that suddenly
routed the ill-temper Frank had fallen into. No one was less disposed
than himself to accept of a favor from a perfect stranger; but the tone

such; and as he stood uncertain what answer to make, the Count added:

The caleche had drawn up as he spoke, and the courier stood, cap in
hand, beside the door, so that Frank had no time for any but an abrupt
refusal, and that he could not give; he therefore bowed his head, and
sprang in. The door was slammed sharply to, and the next moment the
horses were rattling along over the snow, the merry bells of the harness
jingling pleasantly as they went.
Probably no two beings could present a much stronger contrast than the
pleasure-sick, weary, and discontented; the other, poor, and almost
friendless, full of hope, and ardent with all the buoyancy of youth. The

Frank Dalton had all the outward signs of a youth rich in every accident

as it ever will do, the levity of thinking; and he suffered himself to
believe that ‚Äúhe was no worse than others.‚Äù A more fatal philosophy than

of the entrance-gate, and, winding over the ‚Äúglacis,‚Äù crossed the

It was a clear, bright day of winter; the blue sky almost cloudless, and
the sharp outline of every object stood out, crisp and well defined, in
the thin atmosphere. Nothing could be more favorable for the effect of
the gay trappings and brilliant uniforms showed in all their splendor,
the scarlet Lancers, the blue-clad Hussars, the Cuirassiers, with their
towering helmets, vied with each other in soldierlike bearing; while the

there.

‚ÄúOh, let us follow them!‚Äù cried Frank, enthusiastically. ‚ÄúSuch a

in the very depth of winter, and spend a day in the snow of the Prater.‚Äù
‚ÄúWho could have a thought for weather or hardship when engaged in such a
division, who, well mounted, and swathed in furs, canter down to the
ground, an hour after we have reached it, and ride back again when they
have 'taken the salute,' leaving us to plod wearily home, through wet
roads and sloppy streets, to our cold barracks. But just the reverse
is the opinion of those poor fellows yonder, with blue faces and
frostbitten knuckles, and who have neither pride in this display, nor
sympathy with the success of what is called 'a fine manoeuvre.'‚Äù
Frank shook his head distrustfully. He wished not to credit the opinion,
‚ÄúThat is the 'Franz Carl,' Dalton,‚Äù said Walstein, pointing to a column
of infantry, who, in their dark gray overcoats, seemed a sad-looking,
gloomy mass. ‚ÄúThey've got the best band and the most savage colonel in
the service.‚Äù
Frank gazed at the regiment with a strange sensation of awe and fear.

kreutzers, waltz at the wine-gardens, and fight duels with sabres.‚Äù
Frank laughed at the description; but his laugh had more of gloom
than mirth about it, for he felt at every moment the false position
becoming. Every allusion to others showed him in what light he was

‚ÄúThere 's the corps for you, Dalton,‚Äù said Walstein, drawing his
attention to the ‚ÄúHungarian Guard,‚Äù all glittering with gold embroidery,
and mounted upon the most beautiful white chargers, at once the most
perfect riders and the best mounted cavalry in Europe. ‚ÄúIn that regiment
you are certain of being quartered either here or in Prague. Those laced
jackets are too costly wear to send down to the Banat, or among the
wilds of Wallachia. Besides, the Empress likes to see these gaudy
fellows on their 'schimmels' beneath the Palace windows. Your uncle
will, of course, grumble a little about the cost. Perhaps your father,
a 'dolman,' and four for a 'schabrach;' while ten or twelve horses the
Still, depend upon it, the corps is as good for service as it is costly,
and Creptowitz, their Colonel, is a true hussar.‚Äù
For a moment Dalton hesitated whether he should not make the honest
habits of cost and expense; but shame was too powerful to permit the
that any candor now would be the confession of a cheat. If these were
glimmered through the gloom; and this was, what he might expect from his
uncle. ‚ÄúIf he be really rich, as they say,‚Äù thought Frank, ‚Äúif his favor
be so great with the Emperor, even such a career as this may not be
above my prospects.‚Äù As he revolved these thoughts, he sat with his head
‚ÄúYou 're losing everything, Dalton,‚Äù said Walstein. ‚ÄúSee, there go
the 'Kaiser Jagers,' with their bugles, the finest in the service; and
yonder are the Lichtenstein 'Light Horse,' mounted on thorough-bred
cattle; and there, to the left, those savage-looking fellows with long
beards, they are the 'Croat Grenadiers.' But here comes the Emperor!‚Äù
 And, as he spoke, one deafening cheer burst forth along the line, and
was echoed back from the walls of Vienna; while every band struck up
the national hymn of Austria, and the proud notes of ‚ÄúGod preserve the
Emperor!‚Äù floated through the air.
A brilliant staff of generals of every arm of the service accompanied
‚Äúthe Kaiser;‚Äù and Walstein ran quickly over the names of these, many of
whom were among the first nobility of the Empire. Some were the war-worn
veterans of the great campaigns; some the young hopes of Austrian
well as the singularity of his uniform, attracted Frank's notice. He was
gold, and actually covered with the crosses and decorations of various
almost a compromise between the present and some bygone age.
The figure of the wearer, too, suited well this impression. There was
which relaxed into the polished urbanity of an old courtier as often as
the Emperor addressed him. When bowing to the mane of his charger, he
seemed the very type of courtesy; while, as he retired his horse, there
was all the address and ease of a practised rider.
‚ÄúThere, to the left of Walmoden, on the powerful black horse, do you see
that handsome old man in the purple tunic?‚Äù said Waldstein.
‚ÄúYes. It was the dress of the Artillery of the Imperial Guard in the
leave of the Emperor, a favor he only avails himself of on occasions
like the present.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe has all that the Empire can bestow, from the 'Iron Cross' to the
'Maria Teresa.' He has the 'Legion of Honor,' too, sent him by Napoleon
himself! It was that officer who at Elchingen rode up to the head of a
French column, and told them that the wagons they were pursuing were the
'ammunition of the rear-guard!' 'If you advance,' said he, 'we 'll fire
them, and blow you and ourselves to atoms!' The coolness and heroism of
the daring were well acknowledged by a brave enemy. The French halted,
and our train proceeded on its way. Mayhap you have heard the anecdote
‚ÄúNever,‚Äù said Frank, still gazing with admiration at the old soldier.
‚ÄúThen I may as well tell you that he is the Count Dalton von Auersberg,‚Äù
 said Walstein, lying back to enjoy the youth's amazement.
But Frank never heard or heeded the remark; his whole soul was wrapped
up in the contemplation of the old field marshal, on whom he gazed as a
‚ÄúHe 's like my father,‚Äù muttered Frank, half aloud; ‚Äúbut
‚ÄúNot here, though, not here!‚Äù said Walstein, laying his hand on the
youth's arm; for he almost feared lest he should give way to the sudden
impulse. ‚ÄúWere you even the Colonel of your regiment, you could not

To afford the reader the explanation contained in the preceding chapter,
and suspense, for the hour of Mrs. Ricketts's visit. Although her mind
principally dwelt upon the letter which had been announced as coming
from her father, an event so strange as naturally to cause astonishment,
she also occasionally recurred to the awkwardness of receiving persons
before, and the incident would have worn a very different aspect to
her eyes. She would have dwelt alone on the kindness of one, an utter

associated with the event as it at present stood. She was greatly
changed in many respects. She had been daily accustomed to hear the
slightly censured. For every fault and failing there was a skilful
excuse or a charitable explanation. The errors of the fashionable world
were shown to be few, insignificant, and venial; and the code showed no
exception to the rule that ‚Äúwell-bred people can do no wrong.‚Äù Vulgarity
alone was criminal; and the sins of the underbred admitted of no
judgments, had reason been ever appealed to; but such was not the
case. Ridicule alone was the arbiter; whatever could be scoffed at was
the few depreciatory remarks of Lady Hester concerning her, would have
It was, then, in no pleasant flurry of spirits, that, just as the clock
struck three, Kate heard the heavy door of the palace flung wide, and
the sound of wheels echo beneath the vaulted entrance. The next moment

however, she actually glanced at the windows to see if it had attracted
notice, with a kind of terror at the ridicule it would excite. Never did
intolerable a noise before! Why would people dress up their servants
like harlequins? What was the meaning of that leopard-skin rug for the
feet? It was an odious little vehicle, altogether. There was a tawdry,
groom of the chambers; and although his features were immaculate in
their expressions of respect, Kate felt offended at what she thought was
a flippancy in the man's manner.
Although the announcement was thus made, the high and mighty personages
were still three rooms off, and visible only in the dim distance, coming

who, from being loaded like a sumpter-mule with various articles for the
road, was passed over by the groom of the chambers, and believed to be a

momentarily dropping some of the articles with which he was charged;

If the reader has ever watched a great tragedy queen emerging from
the flats, when, after a lively dialogue with the prompter, and the
utterance of a pleasant jest, she issues forth upon the open stage, to
vent the sorrows or the wrongs of injured womanhood, he may form some
faint idea of the rapid transformation that Mrs. Ricketts underwent
as she passed the door-sill. Her first movement was a sudden bound

were present. Some she omitted herself; others had begged off of their
own accord. Midchekoff, however, was there; for, however accustomed to
the tone and habits of a life of mere dissipation, he possessed every

Hester, however, he did come, and condescended, for ‚Äúthe nonce,‚Äù to

smoothness of manner, with certain notabilities of the Court, made up

The guests were courteous and pleasing; but all was of the quietest,

delinquencies furnish all the interest. The royal guest imposed a
reserve which the presence of the Cardinal deepened. The conversation,
like the cuisine, was flavored for fine palates; both were light,
suggestive, and of easy digestion. Events were discussed rather than the
actors in them. All was ease and simplicity; but it was a stately kind
So Kate Dalton felt it; and however sad the confession, we must own that
she greatly preferred the free and easy tone of Lady Hester's midnight
receptions to the colder solemnity of these distinguished guests.
Even to the Cardinal's whist-table, everything wore a look of state and
solemnity. The players laid down their cards with a measured gravity,
and scored their honors with the air of men discharging a high and
important function. As for the Archduke, he sat upon a sofa beside
Lady Hester, suffering himself to be amused by the resources of her

had been invited for the evening, distract her from her half revery.

on the contrary, had an eye for everything; from the chandeliers on the
walls to the crosses on the dress-coats, from the decorations of the
salons to the diamonds, he missed nothing; and with such impartial
fairness did he bestow his glances, that the Cardinal's cheeks grew red
as his own stockings as Scroope surveyed him. 'At last he reached the
end of the great drawing-room, and found himself standing in front of
the canopied seat where the Archduke sat with Lady Hester. Not heeding,
if he even remarked, the little circle which etiquette had drawn in
front of the Prince, Purvis advanced within the charmed precincts and
stared steadily at the Duke.

came dropping in from theatres, and operas, and late dinners. These men
of pleasure looked jaded and tired, as usual; and, except the little

walked along the corridors.
When they entered Lady Hester's boudoir, they found that lady recounting
to Midchekoff the whole circumstances of the morning's adventure, a
recital which she continued without other interruption than a smile or
a nod, or a little gesture of the hand to each of the new arrivals as
he came in. If the lady's manner was devoid of all ceremony, that of the
gentlemen was less ceremonious still; for they stretched themselves on
divans, rested their legs upon chairs, and stood back to the fire, with
a degree of careless ease that bespoke them thoroughly at home, Jekyl,

There is something of mediaeval look and air about the Ponte Vecchio
in Florence, which gives it a peculiar interest to the traveller. The
quaint little low shops on either side, all glittering with gold and
gems; the gorgeous tiaras of diamonds; the richly enamelled cups and
vases aside of the grotesque ornaments of peasant costume; the cumbrous
ear-rings of stamped gold; the old-fashioned clasps and buckles of
massive make; the chains fashioned after long-forgotten models; the
are all thrown about in a rich profusion, curiously in contrast to the
humble sheds for they are little more that hold them.
The incessant roll of equipages,--the crowd and movement of a great
city; the lingering peasant, gazing with rapturous eyes at the
glittering wares; the dark Israelitish face that peers from within;
the ever-flowing tide of population of every rank and age and country,
giving a bustle and animation to the scene, so beautifully relieved by
the view that opens on the centre of the bridge, and where, in a vacant
space, the Arno is seen wending peacefully along, and scattering its
circling eddies beneath the graceful arches of the ‚ÄúSanta Trinita,‚Äù that
little glimpse of hill and vineyard and river, the cypress-clad heights
of San Miniato, and the distant mountain of Vallombrosa, more beautiful
far than all the gold Pactolus ever rolled, or all the gems that ever
There was one stall at the end of the bridge so humble-looking and so
if to confirm the impression of the scanty traffic that went on, the
massive door was barred and bolted like the portal of a prison. An

There may have been much of exaggeration in the stories that went of
the Jew's enormous wealth; doubtless many of the accounts were purely
sums sufficient to maintain the credit of many a tottering state, or
support the cost of warlike struggles to replace a dynasty. To him came
the heads of despotic governments, the leaders of rebellious democracy,
the Russian and the Circassian, the Carlist and the Cristino. To the
proud champion of divine right, or the fearless promulgator of equality,

debarred, gold is the picklock to the doors of palaces as of prisons;
two centuries had never borne any other name than the ‚ÄúCasa Morlache.‚Äù
Various reasons were given out for a choice so singular; among others,
it was said that the Grand-Duke was accustomed to visit the Jew by means
of a secret passage from the ‚ÄúPitti;‚Äù while some alleged that the secret
frequenters of Morlache's abode all came by water, and that in the dark
night many a boat skimmed the Arno, and directed its course to the last
arch of the Ponte Vecchio. With these rumors we have no concern, nor
When Kate Dalton had driven up to the door, she had all but determined
to abandon her intention. The arguments which in the morning had taken
herself for even the momentary yielding to Jekyl's counsels. Her only
doubt was whether to drive on without further halt, or leave some short
message, to the effect that she had called but could not delay there.
This seemed the better and more courteous proceeding; and while she was
yet speaking to the dark-eyed, hook-nosed boy who appeared at the door,
going to the palace, and we shall miss him.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat I have already told Morlache the whole story, and obtained his
promise for the loan.‚Äù
morning, the matter was fully agreed on between us; but still, if
‚ÄúNot for the first time, be assured. Even Croesus looked up from his
investment!' But stay; there is Purvis yonder. He is pretending to

‚ÄúWhat shall I do?‚Äù exclaimed the poor girl, now torn by impulses and
emotions the most opposite.
‚ÄúOne thing you must do at once,‚Äù said Jekyl; ‚Äúget out of the carriage
and visit two or three of the shops, as if in quest of some article of
jewelry. His anxiety to learn the precise object of your search will
Kate that she at once descended, and took Jekyl's arm along the bridge.
They had not gone many yards when the short, little, shuffling step of
Purvis was heard behind them. Lingering to gaze at some of the splendid
objects exposed for sale, they at last reached a very splendid stall,
And now Purvis had stationed himself exactly behind them, with his head
most artistically adjusted to hear everything that passed between them.
even turning his eye from the glass case, said, in a voice of some
scheme, she was not the less eager to be free of the presence of the
brilliants, ‚Äúwould not go ill with the necklace, although the stones are

‚ÄúSo it is,‚Äù said Jekyl, quickly. ‚ÄúLet us see what value they place upon

 And with these words he hurried her along, laughing, in spite of all her
anxieties, at the absurdity of the adventure. ‚ÄúHe 'll see the carriage
when he comes out,‚Äù added he, ‚Äúand so I 'll tell the coachman to drive
slowly on towards the Pitti.‚Äù And thus, without asking her consent, he
assumed the full guidance at once; and, ere she well knew how or why,
she found herself within the dark and dusty precincts of Morlache's
neat little chamber on the level of the Arno, the window opening on the

depressing the chamber with the changes in the current of the river;
otherwise the room must have been under water for a considerable portion
of the year. While he descanted on the ingenuity of the mechanism,
and pointed attention to the portraits along the walls, the Kings and
Kaisers with whom Morlache had held moneyed relations, the minutes
against time, the figety nervousness of his manner, and the frequent
glances he bestowed at the timepiece, showing how impatiently he longed
for the Jew's arrival. To all Kate's scruples he opposed some plausible
of the loan; that the visit might be as one of mere curiosity, to
see some of those wonderful gems which had once graced the crowns of
royalty; and that, in any case, the brief delay would disembarrass them
on the score of Purvis, whose spirit of inquiry would have called him
off in some other direction. At last, when now upwards of half an hour
had elapsed, and no sound nor sight bore token of the Jew's coming,
patiently for a few minutes, he left the room.
terrified her; the minutes, as she watched the clock, seemed drawn out
there. To this state of almost feverish excitement succeeded a low
and melancholy depression, in which the time passed without her
consciousness; the half-dulled sounds of the city, the monotonous plash
of the stream as it flowed past, the distant cries of the boatmen
as they guided their swift barks down the strong current, aiding and
increasing a feeling that was almost lethargic. Already the sun had sunk
below the hills, and the tall palaces were throwing their giant shadows
across the river, the presage of approaching night, and still she sat
there all alone. Jekyl had never returned, nor had any one descended the
stairs since his departure. Twice had she shaken off the dreamy stupor
that was over her, and tried to find the door of the chamber, but,

with anxiety and disappointed, she sat down beside the window, gazing
listlessly at the water, and wondering when and how her captivity was to
The lamps were now being lighted on the quays, and long columns of light
streaked the dark river. Across these a black object was seen to glide,
against the current, and headed up the stream. As she watched, it came
nearer and nearer; and now she could hear distinctly the sound of voices
making for the centre arches of the bridge, the boat was vigorously
impelled across the river, and its course directed towards the very
It was clear there were persons coming; in another moment she would
there, and thus exposed to every surmise and suspicion that chance
these were as nothing to the misery which coming events seemed full of.
For a second or two she stood irresolute, and then with something like
an instinct of escape, she stepped out upon the little terrace that
supported the flowers, and, trembling with fear, took her stand beneath
the shadow of one of the great buttresses of the bridge. The frail and
her feet rolled along the dark river, with a low and sullen sound like
moaning. Meanwhile the boat came nearer, and slowly gliding along, was
at last brought up at the window. Two figures passed into the chamber,
and the boatmen, as if performing a long-accustomed task, rowed out a
few lengths into the stream to wait.
From the window, which still remained open, a stream of light now
issued, and Kate's quick hearing could detect the rustling sound of
papers on the table.
‚ÄúThere they are,‚Äù said a voice, the first accents of which she knew to
belong to the Abbe D'Esmonde. ‚ÄúThere they are, Signor Morlache. We have
no concealments nor reserve with you. Examine them for yourself. You
will find reports from nearly every part of the kingdom; some more, some
less favorable in their bearings, but all agreeing in the main fact,
that the cause is a great one, and the success all but certain.‚Äù
‚ÄúI have told you before,‚Äù said the Jew, speaking in a thick, guttural
cause is good, every bankrupt one the reverse, in my estimation.‚Äù
‚ÄúAy, who are the committee?‚Äù interrupted the Jew, hastily.
‚ÄúThe committee contains some of the first Catholic names of Ireland, men
of landed fortune and great territorial influence, together with several
of the higher clergy.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe bishops, almost to a man, are with us in heart; but their peculiar
position requires the most careful and delicate conduct. No turn of
fortune must implicate them, or our cause is lost forever.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf your cause be all you say it is, if the nationality be so strong,
and the energies so powerful as you describe, why not try the issue, as
the Italians and the Hungarians are about to do?‚Äù said Morlache. ‚ÄúI
can understand a loan for a defined and real object, the purchase of
understand how the lender, too, could calculate his risk of profit or
loss on the issue of the struggle; but here you want half a million
to the fold of the Church the long-lost sheep; and make Ireland, as she
once was, the centre of holy zeal and piety!‚Äù
with a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúYou must try other arguments with me; and once
their lives in the venture?‚Äù
‚ÄúHave I not told you what and who they are who form this party?‚Äù said
D'Esmonde, passionately. ‚ÄúRead those papers before you. Study the secret
reports sent from nearly every parish in the kingdom. In some you will
find the sworn depositions of men on their death-beds, the last words
their lips have uttered on earth, all concurring to show that Ireland
has no hope save in the Church. The men who now stir up the land to
revolt are not devoid of courage or capacity. They are bold, and they
are able, but they are infidel. They would call upon their countrymen
in the name of past associations, the wrongs of bygone centuries; they
would move the heart by appeals, touching enough, Heaven knows, to the
galling sores of serfdom, but they will not light one fire upon the
altar; they will not carry the only banner that should float in the van
of an Irish army. Their bold denouncings may warn some; their poetry
will, perhaps, move others; but their prose and verse, like themselves,

‚ÄúEngland is too powerful for such assailants,‚Äù said the Jew.
‚ÄúVery true; but remember that the stout three-decker that never struck
to an enemy has crumbled to ruin beneath the dry rot,‚Äù said D'Esmonde,
with a savage energy of manner. ‚ÄúSuch is the case now. All is rot and
nobles, more tolerant as the commonalty grows more ambitious; resources
diminishing as taxation increases; disaffection everywhere, in the towns
where they read, in the rural districts where they brood over their
poverty; and lastly, but greatest of all, schism in the Church, a mutiny
these the evidences of strength, or are they sure signs of coming ruin?
These men will have the same fate as Tone and Emmet, without the
sympathy that followed them. They will fail, and fail egregiously; but
a priest will join them. On the contrary, their scheme will be denounced
from our altars; our flocks warned to stand aloof from their evil
influence. Our bishops will be in close communication with the heads of
the Government; all the little coquetries of confidence and frankness
will be played off; and our loyalty, that's the phrase, our loyalty
demeanor form the contrast to that rampant intolerance that assails us.‚Äù
need no money; such nobility of soul is, after all, the cheapest of
guide, it is the embodiment of public opinion, without which men would
never clothe their sentiments in fitting phrase, or invest them with
those short and pithy apothegms that form the watchwords of party.
Happily, if it be great, it is venal; and although the price be a
princely ransom, the bargain is worth the money. Fifty or a hundred
advocates; some, in assumed self-gratulation over their own prescience,
in supporting our claims in time past, and reiterating the worn
assertion of our attachment to the throne and the constitution; others,
to contrast our bearing with the obtrusive loyalty of Orangeism; and
others, again, going further than either, to proclaim that, but for
stood in the breach, the cause of rebellion would have triumphed.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd is this character for loyalty worth so much money?‚Äù said the Jew,
quickly; ‚Äúbut if the tree be stunted, its fruits are above price. Our
martyrdom will not go unrewarded. The moment of peril over, the season
of concessions will begin. How I once hated the word! how I used to
despise those who were satisfied with these crumbs from the table of the
rich man, not knowing that the time would come when we should sit at the
board ourselves. Concession! the vocabulary has no one word I 'd
change for it; it is conquest, dominion, sovereignty, all together. By
Now, my good Signor Morlache, these slow and sententious English are
a most impulsive people, and are often betrayed into the strangest
‚ÄúAnd what is the game?‚Äù said the Jew, with impatience; ‚Äúfor it seems to
me that you are not about to strike for freedom, like the Hungarians or
the Lombards. What, then, is the prize you strive for?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Catholicism of Ireland, and then of England, the subjugation of the
haughtiest rebel to the Faith, the only one whose disaffection menaces
our Holy Church; for the Lutheranism of the German is scarce worth the
name of enemy. England once Catholic, the world is our own!‚Äù
The enthusiasm of his manner, and the excited tones of his round, full
voice seemed to check the Jew, whose cold, sarcastic features were
turned towards the priest with an expression of wonderment.
 said Morlache, after a long pause. ‚ÄúWhat securities are offered for the
repayment of this sum? for, although the theme be full of interest to
you, to me it has but the character of a commercial enterprise.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut it ought not,‚Äù said D'Esmonde, passionately. ‚ÄúThe downfall of the

Southern Europe will awaken, the great trading communities of the Levant
will resume their ancient place, and the rich argosies of the East once
more will float over the waters of the tideless sea.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot in our time, Abbe, not in our time,‚Äù said the Jew, smiling.

‚ÄúThe night air grows chilly,‚Äù said the Abbe, as he arose and shut the
window; and the boatmen, mistaking the sound for a summons to approach,
pulled up to the spot.
With a sudden spring Kate bounded into the boat, while yet some distance
off, and hurriedly said, ‚ÄúTo the stairs beside the Santa Trinita.‚Äù
The clink of money, as she took out her purse, made the brief command
intelligible, and they shot down the stream with speed.
she stepped from the boat; and a gold Napoleon enforced the caution.
It was now night, the lamps were all lighted, and the streets crowded by
the footway was wet and muddy. Dressed in the height of fashion, all her
with patched and threadbare cloak, had she travelled the dark road from
of danger nor of insult occurring to her happy spirit, the ‚ÄúGute nacht‚Äù

failure has not come of lukewarmness. I will also strive to show him the
nature of my position, and let him know the full extent of the sacrifice

back and share the poverty I cannot alleviate?
I wish them to be otherwise? Alas, I cannot tell; I do not even know my

Thus, lost in thoughts conflicting and jarring with each other, mingling
the long past with the distant future, hoping and fearing, now seeking
self-persuasion here, now controverting her own opinions there, she
walked hurriedly on, unconscious of the time, the place, and even the
admiration. What an armor is innocence! how proof against the venomed
dart of malice? Kate never knew the ordeal through which she was
passing. She neither saw the looks nor heard the comments of those
that passed. If her mind ever turned from the throng of thoughts that
oppressed it, it was when some momentary difficulty of the way recalled
her to herself; for, as she escaped from the smaller streets, the crowd

indeed, if the whole establishment did nothing but munch them during all
their leisure hours, the score need not be greater. Do you know, Hester,
that the rogueries of the Continent are a far heavier infliction than
the income-tax, and that the boasted economy of a foreign residence is
sensibly diminished by the unfortunate fact that one honest tradesman
is not to be found from Naples to the North Pole? They are Spartans in
deceit, and only disgraced whenever the rascality is detected. Now, it
be told that these people are all knaves; their character for honesty is

‚ÄúDo so, then, and lose no time, for I see Midchekoff s chasseur below,

Norwood gave her a look which made her suddenly become scarlet, and then
left the room without speaking.
If he had not been himself a debtor with the greater number of those who
waited below, few could have acquitted themselves more adroitly in such
to apply to them, when to soothe and when to snub them. All these
arts he was both ready and willing to exercise, were it not for the
playing advocate with one leg in the dock.‚Äù
He lingered a little, therefore, as he went; he stopped on the landing
of the stairs to peep out on the tumultuous assemblage beneath, like
a general surveying the enemy's line before the engagement; nor was he

storing up facts for future mention. As he was still looking, the

Curious to learn who, what, and whence the new arrival came, Norwood
hurried downstairs; but all that he could learn from the postilion was
that the stranger had posted from Genoa, using the greatest speed all
the way, and never halting, save a few minutes for refreshment. The
traveller was not accompanied by a servant, and his luggage bore neither

Hester hurried from the room, as if admonished by her watch of the
lateness of the hour, but really anxious to escape further interrogatory
from the Viscount.
When Norwood reached the court, he was surprised to find it empty; not
one of the eager creditors remained, but all was still and silent.
‚ÄúWhat has become of these good people?‚Äù asked he of the porter.
‚ÄúThe stranger who arrived in the caleche awhile ago spoke a few words to

Little scrupulous about the means of getting out of a difficulty,
provided it were only successful, Norwood scarcely bestowed another
thought upon the whole matter, and lounged along the streets, as
forgetful of the late scene as though it had passed twenty years before.
As the Viscount strolled along towards his lodgings, Kate Dalton, with
trembling limbs and palpitating heart, threaded her way through the
was falling. So long as her road lay through the less-frequented
thoroughfares, her appearance excited little or no attention in the
passers-by; but when she entered the Piazza Santa Trinita, all ablaze
with gas-lamps and the reflected lights from brilliant shops, many
stopped, turned, and gazed at the strange sight of a young and beautiful
girl, attired in the very height of fashion, being alone and afoot at
such an hour. Unaccountable even to mystery, as it seemed, there was
something in her gait and carriage that at once repelled the possibility
of a disparaging impression, and many touched or removed their hats
respectfully as they made way for her to pass. To avoid the carriages,
passed close along by the houses; and, in doing so, came within that
brilliant glare of light that poured from the glass doors of the great
Cafe of the Piazza. It was exactly the hour when the idle loungers of
Florence society that listless class who form the staple of our club
life in England were swarming to talk of the plans of the evening, what
The drizzling rain, and the cold, raw feeling of the air prevented their

and fortune, others as destitute of character as of means. Many owned
names great and renowned in history; others bore designations only
chronicled in the records of criminal jurisprudence. All were well
dressed, and, so far as cursory notice could detect, possessed the ease
and bearing of men familiar with the habits of good society. Although
mixing in very distinct circles, here, at least, they met every day on
terms of familiar equality, discussing the politics of the hour and the
events of the world with seeming frankness and candor.
From a small chamber at the back of the cafe, a little tide of loungers
seemed to ebb and flow; while the sharp rattling sound of a dice-box
indicated the nature of the occupation that went forward there. The
small apartment was thronged with spectators of the game; and even
around the door several were standing, content to hear the tidings of a
contest they could not witness.

While thus, as it were, devoting himself to the amusement of the others,
his real occupation was an intense study of their thoughts, what was
uppermost in their minds, and in what train their speculations were

various monarchs of Munster and Conuaught, in times past; but the Prince
was incredulous as to Hibernian greatness; probably the remembrance of

never would have hesitated about the acquisition. Marriage, however, was
cost more than mere money. Nothing but the possibility of losing her
altogether could have overcome this cautious scruple; and Jekyl had

If we have dwelt thus long upon the secret thoughts of the company,

occasional allusion to some social topic, a chance mention of their
scenery, formed the whole; and then, in spite of Jekyl, whose functions
of ‚Äúfly-wheel‚Äù could not keep the machine a-moving, long pauses would

Midchekoff's mind. The stealthy glances of the Russian's eyes towards
Kate, the almost painful anxiety of his manner, to see if she noticed
and gesture, told Jekyl the struggle that was then passing within him.
He had seen each of these symptoms before, though in a less degree,
when the coveted object was a horse or a picture; and he well knew how
nothing but the dread of a competition for the prize would rouse him
‚ÄúI say, Jekyl,‚Äù whispered he, as they retired out of earshot of the
others, ‚Äúhere's a pretty mess Onslow's got in. There has been a fracas
in the street about Miss Dalton. How she came there at such a time, and
alone, is another matter; and George has struck Guilmard, knocked him
down, by Jove! and no mistake; and they're to meet tomorrow morning. Of
course, there was nothing else for it; a blow has but one reparation,
George will have to stand the fire of the first shot in Europe.‚Äù
Jekyl hated a duel. Had he been a member of the Peace Congress, he could
not have detested the arbitrament of arms more heartily. 'It involved

only an adept in all the etiquette and ceremonial of such meetings, he
liked to see his name circulated in these affairs as a kind of guarantee
opportunity of sustaining the prestige of a ‚Äúdead shot.‚Äù
It was, then, with an ardor of amateurship that he narrated the various
little preliminary steps which had already been taken. Merkheim, the
Austrian secretary, had called on him, on the part of Guilmard; and as,
in a case so clear, there was little to arrange, the only difficulty lay
in the choice of weapons.

governor will never think of acquitting them.‚Äù
‚ÄúI conclude it is inevitable the meeting, I mean?‚Äù said Jekyl.
‚ÄúTo be sure it is. Onslow took care of that! By the way, Jekyl, how came
she there at such an hour, and alone, too?‚Äù
‚ÄúShe had been shopping, I fancy, and missed the carriage. There was some
blunder, I have heard, about the coachman drawing up at the wrong door.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou know the whole story from beginning to end, Jekyl. I 'd back you
against the field, my boy.‚Äù
The other shook his head with an air of supreme innocence.
‚ÄúThen George knows it?‚Äù added Norwood, half asserting, half asking the

Lady Hester, the Prince, and Jekyl were in earnest conversation in

across the room, took a place beside her. She moved slightly as he drew

English merchant never died out in my heart, for all the aristocratic

toil. I loved the life of labor that disciplined the faculties,
and exercised not alone intelligence, but turned to use the gentler

his head to hide the tears which filled his eyes; for what a terrible

For a few seconds Sir Stafford seemed to revel in all the bright visions
to have momentarily lifted him above the reach of sorrow. He thought of
his son engaged in the active business of life, and displaying in this
new career the energies and resources of a bold and courageous spirit.
He imagined the high-principled youth becoming the British merchant, and
making the name of ‚ÄúOnslow‚Äù great and respected in the old arena of all
their victories, the city of London. Could this but come to pass, were
this dream to be realized, and he would bless the hour that wrecked his
fortune, and thus made his poverty the foundation of future greatness.

Again the whistle was heard, and with the sharp crack of a whip,
secret, George clasped the old man's hand fervidly within his own, and
harnessed, and with lamps lighted, for the morning was still dark, ‚Äúis
Our time is six sharp, and it is now considerably past five, and the way

world will throw over the event!‚Äù
Norwood was provoked at the silence, and tried in various ways to break
it. He spoke of the road, the weather, the horse's trotting action,
the scenery, over which the breaking day now threw fitful and uncertain

said, ‚ÄúDo you see that spot yonder, near the pine-trees? that 's where
Harry Mathews was shot. Malzahn sent the bullet through the brain

shot, and he carried the privilege into the other world with him.
Malzahn knew he might trust his skill, and fired the very instant he
‚ÄúI heard the sound of wheels behind us; who are they?‚Äù said George, not
heeding either the story or the counsel.
‚ÄúThe doctor, I suspect. I ordered a calessino to wait for him at the
door of the palace, and bring him up as fast as possible.‚Äù
‚ÄúWho can tell? We 'll put you up at a short distance; and there 's

The road here became so steep that they were obliged to get down and
walk for some distance, while the horse toiled slowly up behind them. As
they went, Norwood continued to talk on incessantly of this, that, and
t' other, as though bound to occupy the attention of his companion;

and take the thing as I have seen you take it before, as rather good fun
than otherwise.‚Äù
to bestow on me, with the prospect of an ample fortune before me, I was
perfectly ready to turn out with any man who had the right to ask me;
‚ÄúNow that my father is on the verge of utter ruin,‚Äù repeated George,
slowly, ‚Äúthe news came last night, I never felt the desire of life so
so I may tell you that we have not escaped the torrent that is sweeping
away so many of the richest houses in Europe; and what between our
immense liabilities and my father's scrupulous sense of honor, the
own claims on George, and the unpaid acceptances he still held of his.
Norwood started, and turned his keen eyes on the other, but in the calm,

‚ÄúAs to these acceptances,‚Äù said George, not paying attention to what the
other said, ‚ÄúI 'd prefer that they should not be presented to my father

trumpery of mine, when sold, will more than meet them, and I have given
a tone of friendship, suggested by the self-satisfaction the promise of
payment afforded him. ‚ÄúBut, hush! There they are, all together. Let us
talk no more of these matters; and now, George, for Heaven's sake, be
Norwood drew the other's arm within his own as he said this, and
beside a low balcony, overlooking the Val d'Arno and the graceful valley
forward and saluted the company. Nothing could possibly be more easy and
unconstrained than the tone of their conversation, as they chatted away
about the prospect beneath, and over which, like a gauzy veil, the gray
shadow of dawn was hanging. With the exception of an Italian or two,
they were all French, the young fashionables who were the loungers of
the salons and cafes of the city.
‚ÄúAnd the best chocolate I ever tasted out of Paris,‚Äù cried another.
‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù said Norwood. ‚ÄúWe 'll profit by the good counsel.‚Äù And, taking
his paletot, he sat negligently on the wall, surveying the scene below
for the vacant and unoccupied stare of Onslow continued to cause the
Viscount the most intense anxiety. ‚ÄúThese fellows are affecting to be
devilish cool. Let us not be behindhand.‚Äù And, rather by force than mere
persuasion, he dragged Onslow along, and entered the little parlor of
the inn.
A large table, covered with the remains of an ample breakfast, stood
in the middle of the room, and a dish of cutlets was placed to keep hot
before the stove. Several loose sheets of paper lay scattered about the
glanced at them for a moment, and then contemptuously threw them into
the fire.
‚ÄúSit down, George,‚Äù said he, placing a chair for the other; ‚Äúand, if
suppose, in a few minutes. I told him to come with the doctor.‚Äù
the present is not the time to suggest one.‚Äù
‚ÄúBy Jove! he has got a tremendous scar on his cheek; the whole length,
from the eye to the corner of his mouth. English knuckles do not
‚ÄúWell, you 've left him a memorandum of the transaction, any way,‚Äù

of the surgeon, but none had seen nor knew anything of him. An empty
calessino was standing on the roadside, but the driver only knew that
the gentleman who came with him had got out there, and entered the park.

upon two seconds on either side. Like the gambler that always is calling

George returned to the spot, but without any success. The man stated
that he took his stand, as he was desired, at the gate of the palace,
which way the others had gone, and how long before they had started.
‚ÄúSee that you pick them up then,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúbut don't pass them. He
talked incessantly,‚Äù added the man, ‚Äúthe whole way, but in such bad

George was just turning away, when his eye caught a glimpse of the
than the Val d'Arno around Florence. The beautiful city itself, capped
with many a dome and tower, the gigantic castle of the Bargello, the
graceful arch of the Baptistery, the massive facade of the Pitti, all,
even to the lone tower on the hill where Galileo watched, rich in
their storied memories; while on the gentle slope of the mountain stood
hundreds of beauteous villas, whose very names are like spells to the
imagination, and the Dante, the Alfieri, the Boccaccio, vie in interest
with the sterner realities of the Medici, the Pazzi, the Salviati, and
the Strozzi. What a flood of memory pours over the mind, to think how
alley of cedars, have witnessed the most intense passions, or the most
Not in such mood as this, however, did Onslow survey the scene. It was
in the rapt admiration of its picturesque beauty. The glittering river,
now seen and lost again, the waving tree-tops, the parterres of bright
flowers, the stately palaces, whose terraces were shadowed by the
magnolia, the oleander, and the fig, all made up a picture of rich and
beautiful effect, and he longed to throw himself on the deep grass and
heard the sharp cracking of a postilion's whip immediately beneath him,
all the power of eight horses to each could barely drag along against
the steep ascent. A mounted courier in advance proclaimed that the
travellers were persons of condition, and everything about the equipages
themselves indicated wealth and station. As Onslow knew all who moved
northward so early in the year, and, stepping into a little copse beside
the road, he waited for the carriages to pass.
They came slowly forward, now halting to ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù the weary horses, now
struggling for a brief space against the hill, and at last, turning a
sharp angle of the way, the first carriage drew short up, directly in
front of where he stood. The panels bore the flaunting and pretentious

own dominions. As George glanced at these, he started, for a well-known
the words, but the accents were her own. ‚ÄúOh for one look at her,
for the last time!‚Äù thought he; and dashed headlong through the copse
towards where, by another bend, the road made a rapid turn upwards.
Already the horses had regained their wind, and were away at a brisk
trot, as George tore onward through the closely interwoven branches and
thick underwood of the grove. There was no path, nor, once out of sight
or sound of the road, anything to guide him; but he dashed on, in the
direction he supposed the carriage must take. At every step the way grew
more intricate and difficult; the pits the peasants dig for chestnut
leaves, the little heaps collected for firewood, intercepted him at
each moment. With torn clothes and bleeding hands he still rushed madly,
scar, at last gained the open country just in time to see the second
carriage crowning the peak of the mountain above his head, while he
could hear the sharp, clanking sound of the drag as they fastened it to
the leading carriage. Any attempt to overtake them on the hill must
now be hopeless. He well knew the pace at which a continental postilion
descends a mountain, and how the steepest galleries of Alps and
see the winding zigzags of the road, and at each turning he fancied
vineyards from base to summit; but, from the steepness of its side,
these terraces were but narrow strips of ground, barely sufficient for
the vine-dresser to pass when tending his plants, or gathering in their
giddy sensation, and few could have surveyed the precipitous descent
object, to see Kate once, and for the last time. By a straight descent
of the mountain, leaping from terrace to terrace, it was possible for
him to reach the bottom before the carriages could traverse the winding
course of the road; and no sooner was the thought conceived than he

George never hesitated when once the undertaking seemed practicable. By
sidelong leaps he descended the first three or four terraces well and
safely. Impressed with the risk of the exploit, he never turned his eyes
from the spot whereon he meant to alight, and measured every bound with
accuracy. Suddenly, however, his attention was caught by the postilion's
bugle sounding, several hundred feet below him, and, in a bend of the
road, he saw the dust left by the fast-descending carriage. Forgetful of
tremendous bound cleared one terrace completely, and alighted on the one
was on the very verge of the cliff. Even yet his presence of mind might
have rescued him, when the loose masonry gave way, and carried him
down with it. He fell forwards, and headlong; the force of the descent
unconscious heap of clay, in the long grass of the valley.
Not fifty yards from where he lay, the carriages passed, and Kate even
leaned from the window to gaze upon the winding glen, little thinking
how terrible an interest that quiet scene was filled with. And so the
equipages held their speed, and pressed onward; while, with a faint
